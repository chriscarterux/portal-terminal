# Portal Terminal - Implementation Strategy

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal**: Basic terminal functionality with block interface

Priority Order:
1. **Terminal Infrastructure** - Electron + xterm.js setup
2. **Block UI System** - Command blocks with React components  
3. **PTY Integration** - Cross-platform shell support
4. **Basic MCP Client** - Protocol foundation
5. **Local AI Setup** - Model loading and basic inference

**Success Criteria**: 
- Commands execute in blocks
- Cross-platform shell support
- Basic AI suggestions working
- MCP client connects to servers

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Weeks 5-8)
**Goal**: Full AI provider support and MCP enhancement

Priority Order:
1. **Local AI Models** - GPT-OSS-120B and 20B integration
2. **External Providers** - OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen
3. **MCP Servers** - All 8 core servers integrated
4. **Context System** - Rich context for AI prompts
5. **Provider Management** - UI for configuring providers

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)  
**Goal**: Polish, performance, and collaboration prep

Priority Order:
1. **Performance Optimization** - WebGL, virtualization
2. **Advanced UI** - Themes, customization, settings
3. **Session Management** - Multiple terminals, workspaces
4. **Collaboration Foundation** - Sharing infrastructure

## Implementation Approach

### Week-by-Week Breakdown

**Week 1: Project Setup**
- Set up monorepo structure
- Configure build system and tooling
- Initialize core packages
- Set up Claude Code memory system
- Create basic Electron app shell

**Week 2: Terminal Foundation**  
- Integrate xterm.js and node-pty
- Implement basic command execution
- Create block UI components
- Set up IPC communication

**Week 3: MCP and AI Foundation**
- Implement MCP client
- Set up local AI model loading
- Create AI provider abstraction
- Basic suggestion system

**Week 4: Integration and Testing**
- Connect all components
- Cross-platform testing
- Performance baseline
- Documentation and demos

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Build Order Priority
1. **Core before Features** - Solid foundation first
2. **Local before External** - Offline functionality first  
3. **Performance before Polish** - Speed before aesthetics
4. **Testing at Each Step** - Validate before proceeding

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Proven Technologies** - Use same stack as successful terminals
2. **Incremental Development** - Working software at each milestone
3. **Performance Focus** - Benchmark against Warp throughout
4. **Community Feedback** - Early beta testing
