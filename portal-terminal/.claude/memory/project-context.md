# Portal Terminal - Project Context

## What We're Building
Portal is an AI-powered terminal application that reimagines the command-line experience with:
- Local AI models (GPT-OSS-120B, GPT-OSS-20B) for privacy
- External AI provider support (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for enhanced context
- Real-time collaboration features
- Block-based command interface
- One-time purchase model at $29.95

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Planning and initial setup
- **Priority**: Build core terminal foundation first
- **Architecture**: Electron + React + xterm.js (following Warp's proven approach)
- **Next Steps**: Initialize file structure and basic terminal functionality

## Key Differentiators
1. Hybrid AI (local + external providers)
2. Privacy-first design
3. MCP integration for enhanced context
4. One-time purchase vs subscriptions
5. Real-time collaboration
6. Built on proven open source foundation

## Target Users
- Primary: Senior Full-Stack Developers
- Secondary: DevOps Engineers  
- Tertiary: Development Teams

## Success Criteria
- Match Warp's performance standards
- 50k purchases in first 18 months
- Sub-500ms AI response times
- Cross-platform compatibility
